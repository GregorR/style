# Contractions

(This is Gregor Richards's specific thoughts on contractions in formal writing.
For style thoughts in general, see [the main document](STYLE.md).)

Use contractions anywhere where you would use contractions in formal speech, so
long as it doesn't create ambiguity. Eschewing contractions makes writing
stilted. Some people have the misbegotten opinion that stilted writing is more
formal; the reality is that stilted writing is poor writing, in any context.
Stilted writing suggests that its author's grasp of English is poor.
Contractions are more natural, and natural writing comes across as confident,
not casual. Moreover, contractions often convey a subtly different connotation
than their uncontracted form, so banning contractions restricts expressiveness
to no gain. Note that, for this reason, it's equally daft to demand that
contractions be used anywhere where contraction is possible. Like any word
choice, the choice to use or not use a contraction should be made thoughtfully.

The proscription of contractions is, in essence, a myth. Of course, as an
element of style, rather than fact, it can't be “untrue”, but it is baseless.
It is an idea that a writing instructor—probably a writing instructor whose
expertise was in a topic other than writing—may have told you at some point,
but they told you so because an equally ill-informed writing instructor told
them so. There are many such myths that form part of common knowledge, but
aren't actually true: the primary colors aren't red, yellow, and blue; the
tongue map isn't real, and all taste buds are general; we use far more than 10%
of our brain, both momentarily and in general; and, contractions are not
informal.

No general style guide has a proscription of contractions. Even Strunk and
White doesn't proscribe contractions—I used to misremember that Strunk and
White was the origin of this proscription, but it's not. The Chicago Manual of
Style itself doesn't mention contractions, but its commentary encourages
contractions. The same is true of MLA. APA doesn't mention contractions; it
doesn't mention much, since it mainly focuses on formatting, but it does
mention some elements of writing style that are particular to academic works,
and contractions are not among them. The Oxford Style Guide doesn't mention
contractions except in describing how to use them. The US's Plain Writing Act
encourages contractions in American legal communication, and legal writing
experts encourage contractions in all legal writing. Fowler comes the closest,
but even it simply reports what is undoubtedly true: contractions are rare in
formal writing, but becoming more common. It doesn't claim that contractions
are informal or discourage their use in any context.

After some research (thanks to [English
StackExchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/) user [Stuart
F](https://english.stackexchange.com/users/319429/stuart-f) for nudging me in
the right direction), I have some idea of where the proscription on
contractions might come from. First, English law prior to the 1700's had
developed so-called “court hand”, rife with abbreviations of all sorts (“Xn”
for “Christian”), and this was outlawed in 1730 (4 Geo II. c. 26) because the
resulting laws were “more difficult to read than Latin records of preceding
ages” ([Hendrickson 1971](https://doi.org/10.2307/356528)). Second, Jonathan
Swift (or as I call him, J'ift) abhorred contractions of all kinds, and was
possibly English's first prescriptivist, wishing “that some Method should be
thought on for ascertaining and fixing our Language for ever” ([Bishop
1998](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/153775779.pdf)). Legal writing is not a
wise place to look for rules of writing, as legal writing is nearly universally
acknowledged as inscrutable; besides, the law was targeted at abbreviations,
not contractions in particular. And, while Swift is widely known as a great
author, he was not and did not claim to be an expert on grammar, usage, or
etymology, and his justification for his disdain for contractions amounts to
little more than sneering at the lower classes.

How many proscriptions of contractions tell you not to use the word “none”? Not
one of them. Hundreds of words in English are contractions that no one cares to
ban: none, never, neither, altogether, already, albeit, also, always, and
beware, to name nine that predate the advent of the apostrophe; ampersand,
cosine, alright, smog, modem, codec, and pixel, to name seven that follow it.
Proscriptions of contractions are ignorant of the very thing they proscribe,
only banning contractions that happen to contain apostrophes. Even if we
rewrite the rule as “don't use contractions that contain apostrophes”, there's
a flaw in that proscription too, since the genitive (possessive) form, “ 's”,
arose as a contraction as well. All apostrophes are contractions, and not all
contractions use apostrophes.

Some contractions are positive, useful advances in language, as they eliminate
ambiguity. The verb “have” typically indicates possession, but is also used as
an auxiliary to introduce the past perfect, as in “I have gone” or, preferably,
“I've gone”. Historically, the contraction was allowed to take either meaning,
but in modern usage, it always indicates the auxiliary: “I've gone” is right,
but “I've two brothers” is wrong. The ambiguity that can arise from these two
forms is actually *eliminated* by using the contraction, making the meaning
clearer. The same is true of “will”, albeit the standard verb is rare: “I'll
go” is right, but “I'll you to go” is meaningless. The same is also true of the
(apostrophe-free) contraction “gonna”, which is only used as the auxiliary to
introduce future tense: “I'm gonna go” is correct in informal speech, but “I'm
gonna the store” is not, eliminating an ambiguity. Of course, “gonna” is
considered slang, and so “common usage is the only valid arbiter of style”
demands its exclusion in formal settings; the point is that contractions are
often *not* lazy, but in fact improve the clarity of language through
disambiguation. Although common speakers don't understand the rules of grammar
in any depth, common people nonetheless settle instinctively on sensible
grammar rules, which is why we have grammar in the first place.

There is one good reason to eliminate contractions from academic writing in
certain circumstances: academic writing is reviewed, and some reviewers are as
puritanical as they are ill-informed. I never use contractions when writing a
grant application, for instance. That's an incorrect decision in terms of
style, but a correct decision in terms of appeasing extremists. In my field
within CS, this rule is not, however, enforced by conference or journal
reviewers, as evidenced by the fact that contractions regularly appear in
conference and journal articles.

Incidentally, if you're going to claim that my own rule 2 suggests that you
should avoid contractions because it's common to avoid contractions in formal
writing, refer back to my rule 5.

*“Now repeat offter me the anti-contraction oath: I will not ever use
contractions; I am going to allow not one to pass my lips. I all so will not
write them, and not either will I tolerate them from others, all be it this
will hand in cap any one from under standing my writing.”*


## Counterarguments to Common Arguments for the Proscription

The hallucinated proscription of contractions in formal writing has been part
of public consciousness for so long, a catalogue of fictitious reasons has been
created for it. This is some of the more common ones.

- **~~The style guides say so.~~** This one is unfortunately promulgated by
  “cheat sheets” for style guides, which are never created by the style guides'
  authors, or even lexicographers. None of the APA, MLA, CMS, Strunk & White,
  or Fowler style guides proscribe contractions. Read the actual style guide.

- **~~It's a well-established rule.~~** No, it's not. If it were, it would be
  in the style guides (see above). It's a well-*known* rule, but so is the
  tongue map (which is nonsense).

- **~~Contractions are from speech.~~** This argument is invalid for several
  reasons. First of all, it's irrelevant: English is not a logographic
  language, so writing is always based on speech, and there are many
  contractions that undoubtedly arose in speech that we're happy to use in
  formal writing, such as “never” and “ampersand”. Second, [it's not even
  true](https://doi.org/10.2307/356528). While undoubtedly *some* contractions
  arose first in speech, contraction in writing (shorthand) has just as long a
  history, and the evidence suggests that many apostrophe contractions arose in
  writing, *not* speech. Contractions are not “eye dialect”, they're a standard
  part of the language.

- **~~Contractions are shorthand.~~** This argument is invalid for largely the
  same reasons as the last. It's irrelevant, as there's plenty of shorthand
  we're willing to use (“Dr.”, “etc.”), and it's untrue, because when shorthand
  starts being said as it's written, it ceases to be shorthand.

- **~~Contractions are informal.~~** Begging the question. I say contractions
  are formal; you say contractions are informal. I've offered a mountain of
  evidence here that they're formal; where is your evidence that they aren't?

- **~~Contractions are lazy.~~** Restricting your word choice is lazy;
  expanding your word choice requires thought in choosing your words.
  Contractions can convey subtly different meaning than their uncontracted
  form, so using contractions thoughtfully is opposed to laziness.

- **~~Contractions are ambiguous.~~** Some contractions certainly *are*
  ambiguous, and should be avoided. Most contractions aren't ambiguous, and
  some *alleviate* ambiguity: we only contract the auxiliary form of “have”,
  “will”, and other auxiliary verbs, so the ambiguity between their auxiliary
  and non-auxiliary forms is removed by using contractions.

- **~~Contractions are conversational.~~** Formal writing should not be too
  conversational, but “too” is a key word here. “Formal” and “conversational”
  are not antonyms, and “formal” and “stilted” are certainly not synonyms.
  Formal writing should be precise, unambiguous, and consistent with the formal
  register of speech; contractions are not imprecise, not ambiguous, and
  standard in formal speech.

- **~~Contractions can confuse foreign readers.~~** All aspects of a language
  can confuse foreign readers, and contractions are not somehow uniquely
  qualified to do so. Besides, as contractions are [morphologically
  distinct](https://doi.org/10.2307/413900) from their uncontracted form—i.e.,
  they do not always have the same meaning as their uncontracted form—a
  language learner who hasn't learned contractions is ill-equipped to interact
  with English on a formal level.
