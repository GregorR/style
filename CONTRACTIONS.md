# Contractions

(This is Gregor Richards's specific thoughts on contractions in formal writing.
For style thoughts in general, see [the main document](STYLE.md).)

Use contractions anywhere where you would use contractions in formal speech, so
long as it doesn't create ambiguity. Eschewing contractions makes writing
stilted. Some people have the misbegotten opinion that stilted writing is more
formal; the reality is that stilted writing is poor writing, in any context.
Stilted writing suggests that its author's grasp of English is poor.
Contractions are more natural, and natural writing comes across as confident,
not casual. Moreover, contractions often convey a subtly different connotation
than their uncontracted form, so banning contractions restricts expressiveness
to no gain. Note that, for this reason, it's equally daft to demand that
contractions be used anywhere where contraction is possible. Like any word
choice, the choice to use or not use a contraction should be made thoughtfully.

What's very interesting about the banishment of contractions is that it
doesn't appear to have any basis in anything. I've been unable to find who
first invented and promulgated this terrible style guideline. No general style
guide has a proscription of contractions. Even Strunk and White doesn't
proscribe contractions—I used to misremember that Strunk and White was the
origin of this proscription, but it's not. The Chicago Manual of Style itself
doesn't mention contractions, but its commentary encourages contractions. The
same is true of MLA. APA doesn't mention contractions; it doesn't mention much,
since it mainly focuses on formatting, but it does mention some elements of
writing style that are particular to academic works, and contractions are not
among them. The Oxford Style Guide doesn't mention contractions except in
describing how to use them. The US's Plain Writing Act encourages contractions
in American legal communication, and legal writing experts encourage
contractions in all legal writing. Presumably, someone, at some point, used
their own stuffiness and poor writing ability to conclude that apostrophes make
writing look lazy, and their bad advice continues to be spread thoughtlessly to
this day.

How many proscriptions of contractions tell you not to use the word “none”? Not
one of them. Hundreds of words in English are contractions which no one cares
to ban: none, never, neither, altogether, already, alright, albeit, also,
always, and beware, to name ten which predate the advent of the apostrophe;
ampersand, cosine, smog, modem, and codec, to name five which follow it.
Proscriptions of contractions are ignorant of the very thing they proscribe,
only banning contractions which happen to contain apostrophes. Even if we
rewrite the rule as “don't use contractions that contain apostrophes”, there's
a flaw in that proscription too, since the genitive (possessive) form, “ 's”,
arose as a contraction as well. All apostrophes are contractions, but not all
contractions use apostrophes.

Some contractions are positive, useful advances in language, as they eliminate
ambiguity. The verb “to have” typically indicates possession, but is also used
as an auxiliary to introduce the past perfect, as in “I have eaten” or,
preferably, “I've eaten”. Historically, this contraction was allowed to take
either meaning, but in modern usage, it always indicates the auxiliary: “I've
eaten” is right, but “I've two brothers” is wrong. The ambiguity which can
arise from these two forms is actually *eliminated* by using the contraction,
making the meaning clearer. The same is true of the (apostrophe-free)
contraction “gonna”, which is only used as the auxiliary to introduce future
tense: “I'm gonna go to the store” is correct in informal speech, but “I'm
gonna the store” is not, eliminating an ambiguity. Of course, “gonna” is
considered slang, and so “common usage is the only valid arbiter of style”
demands its exclusion in formal settings; the point is that contractions are
often *not* lazy, but in fact improve the clarity of language through
disambiguation. Although common speakers don't understand the rules of grammar
in any depth, common people nonetheless settle instinctively on sensible
grammar rules, which is why we have grammar in the first place.

There is one good reason to eliminate contractions from academic writing in
certain circumstances: academic writing is reviewed, and some reviewers are as
puritanical as they are ill-informed. I never use contractions when writing a
grant, for instance. That's an incorrect decision in terms of style, but a
correct decision in terms of appeasing extremists. In my field within CS, this
rule is not, however, enforced by conference or journal reviewers, as evidenced
by the fact that contractions regularly appear in conference and journal
articles.

Incidentally, if you're going to claim that my own rule 2 suggests that you
should avoid contractions because it's common to avoid contractions in formal
writing, refer back to my rule 5.
